#### Introduction
Welcome to the **Fake News Prediction Project**🗞️☕!

Natural Language Processing (NLP is such an important part of machine learning. Nowadays, many applications such as Chat GPT, chatbot, text/ documentation classification, and image recognition surround us! In my previous job, we trained machines to classify medical codes by reading medical reports. I got interested in NLP after knowing its importance and took some classes in DataCamp. This project is guided by DataCamp and I got to learn new concepts such as stopwords, TfidfVectorizer, and Naive Bayes Classifier.
